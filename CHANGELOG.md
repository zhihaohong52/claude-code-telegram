# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **GPS location awareness**: Share your location via Telegram's attachment menu (📎 → Location). Coordinates are stored persistently in SQLite and automatically prepended to every Claude prompt, enabling accurate "near me" queries without repeating your location each session. Supports both one-time and live location shares.
- **`/compact` command**: Summarises the active session into a concise context and starts a fresh Claude session with that summary prepended, reducing context window usage while preserving conversational continuity.

### Changed
- **Location is now optional**: Messages work without a stored location. Claude asks for your Telegram location only when the query is location-specific (e.g. "near me", "nearby"). All other queries proceed normally.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Image/screenshot analysis**: Images sent to the bot are now passed as multimodal content blocks via the SDK, enabling Claude to actually see and analyze them (#168, closes #137)
- **Exponential backoff retry**: Transient `CLIConnectionError` failures are automatically retried with exponential backoff (1s → 3s → 9s, capped at 30s). MCP config errors and timeouts are correctly excluded (#170, closes #60)
- **Local whisper.cpp voice transcription**: New `VOICE_PROVIDER=local` option for offline voice transcription via whisper.cpp + ffmpeg. No API keys required (#158)
- **`make run-watch`**: Auto-restart during development via watchfiles (#158)
- **Inline Stop button**: Cancel running Claude requests with a ⏹ button in the progress message (#122)
- **Slash command passthrough**: Unknown `/commands` in agentic mode are forwarded to Claude as prompts (#131)
- **Proxy support**: Explicit proxy configuration for httpx client via `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` env vars (#166)

### Fixed
- **Empty responses**: "(No content to display)" after tool-heavy tasks — added missing `StreamUpdate` helper methods, fixed `ConversationEnhancer` call signature, and added fallback for tool-only responses (#136, closes #135)
- **ThinkingBlock raw output**: `ThinkingBlock` objects no longer print as raw Python objects — proper `isinstance` checks extract `.thinking` text (#162, closes #161)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Voice Message Transcription**: Send voice messages for automatic transcription and Claude processing. Dual provider support: Mistral Voxtral (default) and OpenAI Whisper (#106)
- **`/restart` command**: Restart bot process from Telegram, plus `set_my_commands` timing fix for reliable command registration on startup (#112)
- **Streaming partial responses**: Stream Claude's output in real-time via Telegram `sendMessageDraft` API. Enable with `ENABLE_STREAM_DRAFTS=true` (#123)

### Fixed
- **`/actions` crash**: Corrected `SessionModel` constructor argument in `get_suggestions` (#125, closes #119)
- **Model config ignored**: `claude_model` setting now passed to SDK `ClaudeAgentOptions`. Default deferred to CLI instead of hardcoded sonnet (#121)

### Documentation
- Linux `aiolimiter` DBus installation workaround (#124)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Outbound image support**: Claude can now auto-detect and send images to Telegram, plus MCP `send_image_to_user` tool (#99)
- **CLAUDE.md loading**: Project-level CLAUDE.md files are loaded from the working directory and appended to the system prompt
- **Configurable reply quoting**: `REPLY_QUOTE` setting controls message quoting behavior, centralized via PTB Defaults (#111)
- **`max_budget_usd` cost cap**: Per-request cost limit passed to SDK via `ClaudeAgentOptions` (#95)
- **`Skill` and `AskUserQuestion`** added to default allowed tools (#85, #87)
- **Documentation site**: Docs index and README linking (#92)

### Changed
- **ToolMonitor replaced with SDK `can_use_tool` callback**: Security validation now uses the native SDK hook instead of a custom wrapper. `SecurityValidator` wired directly into `ClaudeAgentOptions.can_use_tool` (#62)
- **`DISABLE_TOOL_VALIDATION=true`** now passes `allowed_tools=None` to the SDK, fully bypassing tool name validation
- **Phase 5 cleanup**: `src/claude/` reduced from 2,774 to 1,316 lines (#96)
- **PTB `AIORateLimiter`** replaces manual sync-local `RetryAfter` retry (#86)
- **Project thread sync throttling**: Configurable `PROJECT_THREADS_SYNC_ACTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to avoid Telegram API rate limits (#84)
- **GitHub Actions upgraded** to latest versions for Node 24 compatibility (#67, #68)

### Fixed
- **Empty `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` causing Permission denied**: Empty string coerced to `None` so SDK auto-discovers the CLI
- **Session resume failing** with generic exit code 1 (#94)
- **Progress message deletion crash**: Bot no longer stops mid-response when progress message deletion fails (#107)
- **General topic routing**: Messages in the General topic of forum supergroups now route correctly (#110)
- **Session ownership enforcement**: `load_session` and `get_or_create_session` now validate ownership (#83)
- **Bash boundary enforcement**: `cd` and chained commands checked against directory boundary (#69)
- **Handler robustness**: Potential `UnboundLocalError` resolved in message handlers (#66)
- **Claude Code internal paths**: `~/.claude/plans/` and `todos/` allowed in tool validation (#89)
- **`Topic_not_modified` treated as success** in topic sync instead of raising an error
- **Test fixes**: `is_forum=False` set on MagicMock chats to prevent test failures (#110)

### Previously Added
- **Agentic Mode** (default interaction model):
  - `MessageOrchestrator` routes messages to agentic (3 commands) or classic (13 commands) handlers based on `AGENTIC_MODE` setting
  - Natural language conversation with Claude -- no terminal commands needed
  - Automatic session persistence per user/project directory
- **Event-Driven Platform**:
  - `EventBus` -- async pub/sub system with typed event subscriptions (UserMessage, Webhook, Scheduled, AgentResponse)
  - `AgentHandler` -- bridges events to `ClaudeIntegration.run_command()` for webhook and scheduled event processing
  - `EventSecurityMiddleware` -- validates events before handler processing
- **Webhook API Server** (FastAPI):
  - `POST /webhooks/{provider}` endpoint for GitHub, Notion, and generic providers
  - GitHub HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
  - Generic Bearer token authentication
  - Atomic deduplication via `webhook_events` table
  - Health check at `GET /health`
- **Job Scheduler** (APScheduler):
  - Cron-based job scheduling with persistent storage in `scheduled_jobs` table
  - Jobs publish `ScheduledEvent` to event bus on trigger
  - Add, remove, and list jobs programmatically
- **Notification Service**:
  - Subscribes to `AgentResponseEvent` for Telegram delivery
  - Per-chat rate limiting (1 msg/sec) to respect Telegram limits
  - Message splitting at 4096 char boundary
  - Broadcast to configurable default chat IDs
- **Database Migration 3**: `scheduled_jobs` and `webhook_events` tables, WAL mode enabled
- **Automatic Session Resumption**: Sessions are now automatically resumed per user+directory
  - SDK integration passes `resume` parameter to Claude Code for real session continuity
  - Session IDs extracted from Claude's `ResultMessage` instead of generated locally
  - `/cd` looks up and resumes existing sessions for the target directory
  - Auto-resume from SQLite database survives bot restarts
  - Graceful fallback to fresh session when resume fails
  - `/new` and `/end` are the only ways to explicitly clear session context
